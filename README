# Githook plugin Stash to tracker

This is an add-on to Atlassians Stash server which implements a post receive git hook to update Pivotal Tracker stories
with your commit comments and a link to the commit. I can also start and finish stories based on commit tags.

The plugin will loop through all the commits in the change set pushed and update tracker for each commit with a story number.

Add [#nnnnnnn] to your commit message (where nnnnnnn is your story number) and the commit message will be added to the story as a comment

Add [finished #nnnnnnn] and the story will be marked as finished.

more details on the Pivotal interface can be found here https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/api/rest/v5#Source_Commits

you will need the api key from your Pivotal Tracker account https://www.pivotaltracker.com/profile
